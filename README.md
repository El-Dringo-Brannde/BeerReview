## With all the craft brews on the market today it is hard to make sense of what you had, liked, and didn't like. 
Brewster is a mobile site built in AngularJS and HapiJS to help get practice in these JS frameworks. But better yet, it allows a user to review a beer and save it to a database. And they are able to take a picture to better recall the logo the next time they see it in store. Being built in AngularJS there is never a page reload, and everything happens instantaneously. Brewster currently supports JPG file uploads from a mobile device, and resizes and compresses the pictures when displaying it back to the user. It also supports multiple users, so that your review is the only one you see.
